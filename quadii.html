    In progress! I got a Quad II pick and place machine for a steal on EBay. These are professional machines, so the 
    mechanical hardware is far better than most "benchtop" or hobbyist pick and place machines. Because this machine
    was "new" in the '90s, it needs a new controller and vision system. I have been working with 
    <a href="https://github.com/jamelofs">jamelofs</a> to port the STM32 port of RepRapFirmware to the STM32MP157 so
    that the Cortex-M4 can be used for motion control and the Cortex-A7 can be used for vision:
