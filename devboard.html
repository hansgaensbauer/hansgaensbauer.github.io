    The digital design classes at the University of Washington use the DE1-SoC development kit
    from Terasic for all of the lab assignments. Unfortunately, the cost of this board means that
    we cannot keep the hardware after finishing the course, so I designed this very low cost
    alternative instead. I use the MAX V CPLD, which is fully compatible with the toolchain that
    we use in the courses, and all of my labs were able to synthesize and run on the custom hardware.
    Sadly, the department administrators explained that by reusing the kits, they only spent $5 per
    student per quarter, so my $14.70 alternative was too expensive. However, I still use the
    prototype that I built for testing other CPLD projects!
