    <h2>Breadboard USB Power Supply</h2>
    <p>
    A lot of the introductory EE courses at the University of Washington require the use of two
    9V batteries to power analog circuitry on a breadboard for labs, and the wires would always
    fall out of the breadboards. To pass the time during my first week back before courses started
    in my sophomore year, I designed a USB powered breadboard PSU that provides quiet dual supplies
    that can be adjusted from +-2V to +-15V and gave one to everyone on the electronics team in the
    Husky Satellite Lab:
