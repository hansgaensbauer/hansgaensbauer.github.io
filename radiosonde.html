    <h2>Small Radiosonde</h2>
    <p>
    After meeting someone who was studying meteorology, I was fascinated by how dependent weather
    prediction is on the tiny number of radiosondes launched by the NWS and other services around
    the world twice each day. I wanted to try building a much smaller version, so I did:
    <img src="images/radiosonde.jpg" alt="A picture of the radiosonde">\
    <img src="images/radiosonde-comp.jpg" alt="A picture of the radiosonde next to an RS92">
    The lower photo shows one of the radiosonde PCBs next to a Vaisala RS92 for comparison.
    This radiosonde is tracked using multilateration, and can measure pressure, temperature, and
    humidity with accuracy comparable to a Vaisala radiosonde. It uses a little transceiver IC to
    communicate at 433 or 407MHz, and it uses a custom Brokaw bandgap reference temperature sensor
    to give high accuracy temperature readings from -100 to 50 degrees centigrade, at a very low cost.
    I tried to reach someone at the NWS to talk about it, but our meeting fell through and in the
    meantime I convinced myself that this type of radiosonde wasn't the solution - the balloon still has
    to carry itself, so a large balloon is still required even for a tiny radiosonde. Additionally, this
    radiosonde is not that much cheaper than a Vaisala radiosonde. If I ever get the chance, I really want
    to integrate all of the circuitry onto a single IC, which I think would allow the NWS to launch
    thousands of them per day at only a few cents per launch.
