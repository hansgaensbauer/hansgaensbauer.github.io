    <h2>UV Mask Sterilizer</h2>
    <p>
    At the beginning of the pandemic, my father (who is a doctor) and his colleagues were placing used
    medical masks in paper bags and leaving them in a dry room for two days before reusing them. After
    the University of Nebraska published a study suggesting that UV light could be used to sterilize
    N95 Masks without damaging them, my father asked me if I could replicate the system quickly. The
    resulting device was constructed from a duct from Home Depot and two UVC fluorescent lamps from
    McMaster-Carr, and it would deliver the required dose to the mask in 7 seconds. The device is
    currently at my father's office, and I will add images if I can retrieve it after the pandemic.
