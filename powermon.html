    <h2>Outlet Energy Monitor</h2>
    <p>
    This completely analog PCB attaches to the back of a standard outlet and adjusts the color of an LED mounted in
    the switch plate so that you can see how much power the outlet is consuming in real time. I made the PCB
    myself with the CNC mills at the University of Washington, and I was in contact with a Chinese manufacturer
    of outlets for a while about it until they realized that I was not a real engineer and stopped responding.
