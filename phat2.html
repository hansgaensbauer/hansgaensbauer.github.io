    <h2>PHAT-2</h2>
    <p>
    The Platform for High Altitude Technology 2 (PHAT-2) was a balloon mission developed
    by the Husky Satellite Lab, and it was the first project that I was assigned after joining
    the club. Unfortunately, a number of factors meant that the structure and software aspects
    of the balloon were never finished, but I was able to build and test all of the electronics.
    The photos below show the cutdown detector, a langmuir probe controller, the power distribution
    board, and the ADCS/IMU board.

    The coolest part of the driver electronics is the Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) charger and
    igniter. The Advanced Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Washington had a design for
    the charger and igniter circuits that required a 4 layer PCB, it required two separate high
    voltage flyback converters and it would produce huge surges when it fired. These surges killed
    the control electronics for PHAT-1, so I redesigned the charger to provide complete galvanic
    isolation between the PPT and the electrical subsystem during firing. I was also able to
    eliminate one of the flyback converters and use a 2 layer PCB. It could charge a 100uF bank of
    capacitors to 800V in a few hundred milliseconds, and generate 26kV arcs for ignition.

    For this project, I also build a langmuir probe controller and frontend, a power distribution
    board, and a very simple system for detecting when the flight was terminated by a nichrome wire
    cutdown using a single limit switch.
