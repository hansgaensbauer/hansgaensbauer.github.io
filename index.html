    <h1>Hans Gaensbauer - A Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      If you're reading this, you spelled my name right! I am a junior at East High
      School in Denver Colorado with an interest in science and engineering. Here,
      I've outlined all of my most interesting (and best documented) projects from
      this year.

      <h3>High Altitude Balloon: New Design <br />
        3-9-18
        </h3>
      <p>
        I have redesigned the PCB for the balloon!

        We did not remove the ADC, instead, we will redesign the breakouts for
        the MQ sensors using protoboard. We added a JST connector for the PM 2.5
        sensor, and widened the distance between the pads and the polygon pour.
        <br />
        <br />
        The other important change is the addition of a GSM module from DIYmall.
        This will allow the balloon to communicate with SMS while it is at low
        altitude without having to wait for Iridium's servers. More importantly,
        the GSM module has a much higher communication speed, so we can pull
        pictures from the Raspberry Pi on the way down. If we lose the balloon,
        we will still be able to collect all of its data.

      <h3>High Altitude Balloon: A New PCB!<br />
        3-15-18
        </h3>
      <p>
        The PCB has been remade! Using the same process, we created a new version
        of the HAALO PCB using the design above. This time, armed with more experience
        and a new set of drill bits, we were careful to avoid the same mistakes we
        made last time.

        <img src="newvinyl.jpg" alt="the new pcb with vinyl resist applied" />

        Here is the new PCB with the vinyl resist. I was faster removing it
        after spray painting the board, so there were fewer problems with the paint coming
        with the vinyl.

        I didn't have any acid brushes (and I didn't feel like going to the hardware store) so
        I cut up a sponge and hot glued the pieces to a few pencils. We had two
        PCBs and three people (myself and two absolutely brilliant exchange students from
        Italy and Poland), so we took turns emptying the acid while the other two
        scrubbed, and we were done within an hour.

        <img src="dietcoke.jpg" alt="a bottle full of used PCB etchant" />

        When we finished, we were left with one bottle of used PCB etchant. To
        make etching faster, we had to use more acid (as rate is a function of
        concentration, not amount). We neutralized the acid and added aluminum
        to create aluminum chloride, which can be disposed of legally.

        <img src="colletsquared.jpg" alt="a small drill bit mounted in a collet, mounted in a collet" />

        This time, we drilled the through-holes with a mill at my school, a piece of
        equipment which I'm convinced cost more than the building it's housed in. The drill
        bit was way too small for the collet, so we used an equally fancy engine mill
        to turn down my poor micro drill bit collet so that it would fit in the
        5/32" collet in the mill, and, believe it or not, it worked!
