      <h2>Solid State Angle of Attack Sensor</h2>
      <p>
        This sensor uses an ultrasonic emitter and an array of microphones to calculate windspeed and airflow direction without any moving
        parts. By comparing the phase of the recorded signal at each of the microphones, it is possible to calculate the delay or speedup 
        caused by the moving airmass.
        <img src="images/aoa_sensor.jpg" alt="The angle of attack sensor">
        I tested the sensor by fitting it to a car window with cardboard and driving around at different speeds:
        <img src="images/aoa_setup.jpg" alt="AoA Sensor Testing Setup">
        <img src="images/aoa_results.png" alt="Phase plot from AoA sensor">
        The plot shows that the phase change for each mic is correctly correlated with the position of the mic relative to the airflow
        direction and the ultrasound emitter. Mic was furthest forward (see first image above), mic 5 was furthest back. Also, the separation 
        of the phases increases at higher speeds, allowing the sensor to measure airspeed.
        <br>
        Because this is just a prototype, I used a Saleae logic analyzer to capture raw data from each of the mics, and extracted the appropriate
        DFT terms using Goertzel's algorithm (see notebook <a href="AoA Sensor Evaluation.ipynb">here</a>).

      <h2>Ground Penetrating SAR for Finding Lunar Lava Tubes</h2>
      <p>
        This is my writeup of the work I've done developing a ground penetrating synthetic aperture
        radar for the Husky Satellite Lab at UW.
        <br>
        <h3>Background</h3>

        I joined the Husky Satellite Lab (HSL) in 2019, just in time to see the years of hard
        work the group had put into Huskysat-1 culminate in a successful deployment from the
        ISS. After operating the satellite for several months, we transferred control to Amsat
        and all of the older members of the club who had stuck around to see the project through
        moved on. After my first year, virtually all of the older members had left, leaving only
        a handful of us to choose a new project for the group. Professor Robert Winglee (who sadly
        passed away that winter) was our PI at the time, and he strongly encouraged us to develop
        technologies that targeted a lunar mission.
        <br><br>
        I proposed the Ground Penetrating Radar to the group after reading a few articles about lunar
        lava tubes. The first is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103516303566">
        The structural stability of lunar lava tubes</a> by David M. Blair et al., which uses FEA to
        suggest that lava tubes on the moon could be kilometers wide and hundreds of meters tall - large
        enough to fit a small city. A second article (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL071588">
        Evidence of large empty lava tubes on the Moon using GRAIL gravity</a> by Loic Chappaz et al.)
         found supporting evidence for these large subsurface voids in GRAIL gravimetric data.
        Finally, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063317303185">
        A multi-frequency radar sounder for lava tubes detection on the Moon: Design, performance
        assessment and simulations </a>  by Leonardo Carrer, Christopher Gerekos, and Lorenzo Bruzzone"
        presented simulations of a radar sounder instrument that would be able to detect most of the possible
        lava tube geometries described by Blair's paper. After speaking with both David Blair and Cristopher
        Gerekos (who designed the simulator used in the third paper), I thought it would be reasonable to
        try to build the instrument that they had described.
        <br><br>
        Originally, this project had no budget, and I paid for a lot of the equipment out of pocket. After I
        was able to demonstrate a working radar, we were granted $2000 by the Washington NASA Space Grant
        Consortium, which was presided over by Professor Winglee. These funds covered the hardware cost of
        both the GPR itself, as well as the DDS-AWG that we built to test it.

        <h3>Instrument Principles</h3>
        Several physical properties of the moon constrain the radar parameters. Lower center frequencies yield
        greater penetration depths, and larger bandwidths yield finer resolution. There is, however, a tradeoff
        between a lower center frequency and higher bandwidth, because as the fractional bandwidth of the chirp
        becomes very large, the whole system becomes harder to match/tune. Because it is not possible to deploy
        a large, wideband antenna from a small satellite, other orbital synthetic aperture radars (SAR) like the
        LRS, SHARAD, and ALSE use isotropic dipoles for their low frequency experiments; since we would have to do
        this as well, we were very concerned about how well we could match the antenna.
        <br><br>
        We also had to choose an architecture for the radar, with low cost and rapid development taking priority
        over long mission duration or even instrument performance - the goal was a technology demonstration and
        possible lave tube detection, not a detailed characterization or mapping of any lunar lava tubes. We chose
        to use a DDS-based architecture because a DDS gives us unmatched flexibility for our waveform, and because
        it allowed us to keep our analog frontend as small as possible (we only obtained access to a VNA halfway
        through the project). The GPR is based on the LRS - the DDS generates a windowed chirp that is transmitted,
        a T/R switch is flipped, and the echo is amplified and mixed with a second, identical chirp with a known
        time offset. This "de-chirp" method allows us to significantly reduce the required analog bandwidth and
        sample rate for the receiver, since we can trade vertical coverage (the range of our resulting radargrams
        in the nadir direction) for a lower beat frequency from the mixer. This way, we can use chirped signals with
        center frequencies above 100MHz, and sample the beat frequency at 100Mhz or less without approaching the
        Nyquist rate. It is worth noting that the pulse duration is also traded here - long pulses give lower beat
        frequencies, but since the radar is half-duplex, the pulses must be short enough that consecutive pulses do
        not overlap.
        <img src="images/AD9910-DDS.png" alt="A diagram of the GPR">
        We choose to use the AD9910 from Analog Devices as the DDS core for the GPR. At $63, we couldn't beat it
        for price given the level of integration, and it has a number of very useful features that make it perfect for
        our application. First, it has an internal "ramp generator" which can be programmed to sweep amplitude, frequency
        or phase while the DDS operates. This gives us a very easy way to generate the variable length chirps with
        the desired start and stop frequencies. Additionally, the AD9910 has an internal RAM that can be read out
        in order to modulate frequency, phase, or amplitude. By programming the RAM with a Hann window and targeting
        amplitude, we can window the chirp while it is generated. Finally, because the Hann window is completely
        arbitrary, we can tweak the amplitudes to predistort the chirp, in order to account for the transfer function
        of the hardware on the DDS output.
        <h3>Test Plan and the DDS-AWG</h3>
        As we made progress toward specifying the radar parameters, specifically the chirp bandwidth (30MHz) and
        center frequency (80MHz), we realized that evaluating the instrument on Earth would be extremely difficult.
        The first challenge is that there are very few places in Washington or even on Earth that are as dry as the
        moon, with targets that look like lave tubes. Terrestrial lava tubes are too small to be detectable with
        our system, and there was always going to be the challenge of moving the instrument 50-100km away from the
        target to simulate the altitude of a lunar orbit. These challenges, of course, are not insurmountable, and we
        put together detailed plans for overcoming them: we could test with higher frequencies and bandwidths on Earth
        to resolve smaller features, use high altitude balloons to check our instrument at altitude, and run as many
        lab tests as possible to confirm that the radar was behaving as expected. The second problem is that the low
        center frequency and high bandwidth of the radar means that the chirp it generates spans an enormous chunk of
        the VHF spectrum. Professor Winglee was very against obtaining an experimental license from the FCC, and although
        he allowed us to try, the presence of a few military frequency allocations in the band we were interested in
        stalled the process almost immediately.
        <br><br>
        In liu of real-world testing at the system level, I proposed that, in addition to the real-world tests we had
        already described, we could use the radar simulator that Chris Gerekos had built for his lava tube paper to
        simulate reflections from the moon. This simulator starts with a chirped waveform, and computes the echo by
        summing the reflected signals from millions of triangles imported from a user supplied DEM of the lunar surface.
        We could generate a chirp with our instrument and record it with a DSO, and then feed this signal into the
        simulator. We'd allow the simulator to calculate the reflected chirp, and then we would synthesize it, attenuate
        it, and feed it back into the radar after the appropriate delay. Then, we could take the output from the radar
        and perform SAR processing on a collection of these rangelines to recover the radargram, which we would
        compare to the simulated radargrams in Gerekos' paper.
        <br><br>
        This idea garnered the support of Professor Winglee and the rest of the satellite lab, but it required us to
        obtain or design/build a DDS capable of simulating the rangelines returned by Gerekos' simulator. I spoke to
        an engineer at Siglent, and their highest performance AWG could only generate some of the waveforms we are
        interested in. We would not be able to afford the kind of instrument that we needed, so I started working on
        a design built around the DAC5687 from Texas Instruments. This chip can use an onboard NCO to upconvert input
        data at a lower sample rate to a full 500MSps. The rest of the AWG consists only of a CPLD which allows a user
        to program a high speed SRAM with waveform data, and a USB-Serial converter from Microchip. The design files
        and HDL for this DDS are open source and available <a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat/hs2-dds-hardware">on Github</a>.
        <h3>Bringup</h3>
        After Professor Winglee passed away, I laid out hardware for the radar and we purchased the boards and components.
        This is what it looked like after 8 hours of assembly:
        <img src="images/gpr-pcba.jpg" alt="The assembled radar PCB">
        This PCB is designed for development only, so it would not fit in a cubesat form factor and it makes extensive
        use of jumper cables.
        <br><br>
        Progress stalled after I graduated and turned the hardware over to my peers at the Husky Satellite Lab - as I
        understand it, the lab was restructured and nobody was available to pick it up. In August 2021, I reached out
        and asked if I could have the hardware sent to me so that I could keep working on it, and I mounted the radar,
        the DDS, and an STM32 eval board to a sheet of prepreg I had laying around. I wrote a driver for the AD9910
        (open source, on <a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat/hs2-gpr">Github</a>) that allows the instrument to generate
        Hann windowed chirps that match the expected waveform:
        <img src="images/chirp.png" alt="A DSO capture of a Hann Windowed Chirp">
        <img src="images/gpr-2.jpg" alt="The radar setup with a chirp in the background">
        <h3>Radar Simulator Testing</h3>
        The first test of the system involves measuring the length of a spool of coaxial cable from Home Depot.
        Because we cannot legally transit at the frequencies that the radar is designed to use, an end-to-end test is only possible
        if the signal is confined to a cable. I connect the output which would normally feed the PA to one length
        of coaxial cable, and I connect the other end of the cable to the antenna connector. The transmit/receive
        switch is set to receive, and a switch on the PCB feeds the output of the DDS into a power divider. This
        way, half the signal goes through the coaxial cable, and the other half goes directly into the mixer. The
        radar generates a chirp from 65 to 95MHz that lasts for 1 millisecond. The raw output of the mixer is shown
        below, along with the theoretical result:
        <img src="images/dechirp.png" alt="A graph of the theoretical and experimental dechirped signals">
        The Hann windows are not perfectly congruent - this is something we are investigating. It is likely that
        this is an error in the programmed Hann window, but it can be fixed with predistortion in an case. The
        measured tie delay can be calculated by taking an FFT, and dividing by the frequency rate of change. The
        distance is then just the time delay times the speed of light, taking the velocity factor of the coaxial
        cable (0.83 for cheap RG6) into account:
        <img src="images/final_wide.png" alt="Radar results, showing agreement between theoretical and calculated results">
        <img src="images/final_zoom.png" alt="Radar results, zoomed in">
        I've zoomed in on the second image to make the length of the coax more obvious. The system's measured length
        is within 5m (the range resolution) of the true 152m (500ft) length of the coaxial cable. In these images,
        the real system seems to outperform the theoretical calculations, which was bizarre to me. After checking for errors, I realized that this was due to
        the filtering that the real signal had. After digitally filtering the theoretical IF, it outperforms the
        real system:

      <h2>Polkadot Mesh Network</h2>

        I did this project for the embedded systems capstone at UW. I had been toying with the idea
        of building a LoRa mesh network for radio stations, and I took the opportunity to build
        the hardware I was picturing and to learn a lot about mesh networking by implementing AODV
        in embedded C. In our group, I was responsible for the hardware and the mesh networking firmware,
        while my group members built a Raspberry Pi based server that allowed a user to interact with the
        mesh in real time. All of the hardware and the software that I've created is free to share and use,

          the PWM duty cycle of each of the six receiver channels to an SD card, so that the position
          of each of the control surfaces could be logged over the course of a flight. Additionally, the

        After meeting someone who was studying meteorology, I was fascinated by how dependent weather
        prediction is on the tiny number of radiosondes launched by the NWS and other services around
        the world twice each day. I wanted to try building a much smaller version, so I did:
        <img src="images/radiosonde.jpg" alt="A picture of the radiosonde">\
        <img src="images/radiosonde-comp.jpg" alt="A picture of the radiosonde next to an RS92">
        The lower photo shows one of the radiosonde PCBs next to a Vaisala RS92 for comparison.
        This radiosonde is tracked using multilateration, and can measure pressure, temperature, and
        humidity with accuracy comparable to a Vaisala radiosonde. It uses a little transceiver IC to
        communicate at 433 or 407MHz, and it uses a custom Brokaw bandgap reference temperature sensor
        to give high accuracy temperature readings from -100 to 50 degrees centigrade, at a very low cost.
        I tried to reach someone at the NWS to talk about it, but our meeting fell through and in the
        meantime I convinced myself that this type of radiosonde wasn't the solution - the balloon still has
        to carry itself, so a large balloon is still required even for a tiny radiosonde. Additionally, this
        radiosonde is not that much cheaper than a Vaisala radiosonde. If I ever get the chance, I really want
        to integrate all of the circuitry onto a single IC, which I think would allow the NWS to launch
        thousands of them per day at only a few cents per launch.

      <h2>500 Msps DDS-AWG for Radar Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        This project grew out of a need to test a design for an orbital ground penetrating
        radar sounder for detecting lava tubes that I designed for the Husky Satellite Lab at
        the University of Washington. We are not licensed to transmit on the frequencies used
        by the radar sounder, and there are no terrestrial targets with predicted radar
        signatures similar to those of lava tubes on the moon. I proposed that we build a
        system to synthesize radar returns generated by Chris Gerekos' Coherent Multilayer
        simulator, and this is what I built after that proposal was funded.

        <img src="images/dds.jpg" alt="the DDS PCB" >

        The DDS uses an Altera Max V CPLD to load an SRAM with data extracted from Gerekos'
        simulator. When the system receives a trigger signal, the CPLD reads out the data in
        the SRAM at 100Msps into a TI DAC5687 which does all the hard work of numerically
        upconverting and synthesizing the signal. The result is a complex 500Msps output with
        100MHz of bandwidth which can be used as a test input for our radar setup. All of the IP
        that I created for this project is open source, and it can be found at
        <a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat">the UW Cubesat Github Repository</a>.

        The digital design classes at the University of Washington use the DE1-SoC development kit

        we cannot keep the hardware after finishing the course, so I designed this very low cost
        alternative instead. I use the MAX V CPLD, which is fully compatible with the toolchain that
        we use in the courses, and all of my labs were able to synthesize and run on the custom hardware.
        Sadly, the department administrators explained that by reusing the kits, they only spent $5 per
        student per quarter, so my $14.70 alternative was too expensive. However, I still use the
        prototype that I built for testing other CPLD projects!

        An old friend of mine is a musician, so I made them an STM32 based VU Meter that would change

        that used <i>a lot</i> of VCVS stages, I decided to use a digital implementation instead. A simple
        microphone amplifier circuit feeds the raw sound signal to the ADC of an STM32F4, which DMAs a few
        milliseconds worth of samples into a buffer and then uses the ARM CMSIS DSP library to take an FFT.
        The brightness of the RGB leds around the PCB is set in real time by the coefficients from the FFT.

        The Platform for High Altitude Technology 2 (PHAT-2) was a balloon mission developed
        by the Husky Satellite Lab, and it was the first project that I was assigned after joining
        the club. Unfortunately, a number of factors meant that the structure and software aspects
        of the balloon were never finished, but I was able to build and test all of the electronics.
        The photos below show the cutdown detector, a langmuir probe controller, the power distribution

        The coolest part of the driver electronics is the Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) charger and
        igniter. The Advanced Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Washington had a design for
        the charger and igniter circuits that required a 4 layer PCB, it required two separate high
        voltage flyback converters and it would produce huge surges when it fired. These surges killed
        the control electronics for PHAT-1, so I redesigned the charger to provide complete galvanic
        isolation between the PPT and the electrical subsystem during firing. I was also able to
        eliminate one of the flyback converters and use a 2 layer PCB. It could charge a 100uF bank of
        capacitors to 800V in a few hundred milliseconds, and generate 26kV arcs for ignition.

        For this project, I also build a langmuir probe controller and frontend, a power distribution

        cutdown using a single limit switch.

      <h2>Buried Ice Detection with CPR</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this work was to develop a system that would allow future lunar landers to identify
        buried ice deposits with landing radar. I designed, simulated, and built cpol antennas for the
        915 MHz ISM band and then used 400lbs of Concrete and a lot of ice to test the ability of
        the system to identify buried ice. Unfortunately, the sub wavelength roughness of the aggregate
        in the concrete caused really high CPR and all kinds of false positives (I can detect ice when it's
        not buried). At least I learned a lot about concrete.

        I also built a system for automating the CPR measurements using an RF switch controlled by the

        results:

        <img src="images/cpr_results.png" alt="Results of CPR testing" >

        Either the system was nonfunctional (although I did test every component and they performed as expected in
        isolation) or the setup was flawed. Concrete is a poor lunar simulant and I was using a very small box with
        unrealistically small targets in a very noisy environment.
