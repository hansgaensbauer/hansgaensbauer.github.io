    <h1>Project Archive</h1>
    <p>
      This is a living archive of projects that I have done, and it is intented to serve mostly
      as a repository for all of the images that I have saved in various places that I will 
      undoubtedly lose at some point. Every image on this page is my own, and unless otherwise 
      noted all PCBs are my own designs.

      <h2>500 Msps DDS-AWG for Radar Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        This project grew out of a need to test a design for an orbital ground penetrating
        radar sounder for detecting lava tubes that I designed for the Husky Satellite Lab at
        the University of Washington. We are not licensed to transmit on the frequencies used
        by the radar sounder, and there are no terrestrial targets with predicted radar
        signatures similar to those of lava tubes on the moon. I proposed that we build a 
        system to synthesize radar returns generated by Chris Gerekos' Coherent Multilayer
        simulator, and this is what I built after that proposal was funded. 

        <img src="phonecall.png" alt="two hours on the phone with the IRS" />

        The DDS uses an Altera Max V CPLD to load an SRAM with data extracted from Gerekos'
        simulator. When the system receives a trigger signal, the CPLD reads out the data in 
        the SRAM at 100Msps into a TI DAC5687 which does all the hard work of numerically 
        upconverting and synthesizing the signal. The result is a complex 500Msps output with 
        100MHz of bandwidth which can be used as a test input for our radar setup. All of the IP
        that I created for this project is open source, and it can be found at https://github.com/UWCubeSat.

      <h2>Alternative Dev Board</h2>
      <p>
        The digital design classes at the University of Washington use the DE1-SoC development kit
        from Terasic for all of the lab assignments. Unfortunately, the cost of this board means that
        we cannot keep the hardware after finishing the course, so I designed this very low cost 
        alternative instead. I use the MAX V CPLD, which is fully compatible with the toolchain that
        we use in the courses, and all of my labs were able to synthesize and run on the custom hardware.
        Sadly, the department administrators explained that by reusing the kits, they only spent $5 per 
        student per quarter, so my $14.70 alternative was too expensive. However, I still use the 
        prototype that I built for testing other CPLD projects!

      <h2>PHAT-2</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform for High Altitude Technology 2 (PHAT-2) was a balloon mission developed
        by the Husky Satellite Lab, and it was the first project that I was assigned after joining
        the club. Unfortunately, a number of factors meant that the structure and software aspects
        of the balloon were never finished, but I was able to build and test all of the electronics. 

        The coolest part of the driver electronics is the Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) charger and 
        igniter. The Advanced Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Washington had a design for 
        the charger and igniter circuits that required a 4 layer PCB, it required two separate high
        voltage flyback converters and it would produce huge surges when it fired. These surges killed
        the control electronics for PHAT-1, so I redesigned the charger to provide complete galvanic 
        isolation between the PPT and the electical subsystem during firing. I was also able to
        eliminate one of the flyback converters and use a 2 layer PCB.

        For this project, I also build a langmuir probe controller and frontend, a power distribution 
        board, and a very simple system for detecting when the flight was terminated by a nichrome wire
        cutdown using a single limit switch.

      <h2>Buried Ice Detection with CPR</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this work was to develop a system that would allow future lunar landers to identify 
        buried ice deposits with landing radar. I designed, simulated, and built cpol antennas for the 
        915 MHz ISM band and then used 400lbs of Concrete and a lot of ice to test the ability of 
        the system to identify buried ice. Unfortunatelly, the sub wavelength roughness of the aggregate 
        in the concrete caused really high CPR and all kinds of false positives (I can detect ice when it's
        not buried). At least I learned a lot about concrete.

      <h2>Sous Vide Controller</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to see how small I could make a controller for a sous vide. This PCB packs a capacitive 
        power supply (eek!), an ATMega based PID controller and a giant solid state relay, all of which 
        fits in a 2.5 by 1.25 by 0.5 inch box fit along the cord.

        This PCB attaches to the back of a standard outlet and adjusts the color of an LED mounted in 
        the switchplate so that you can see how much power the outlet it consuming in real time.

      <h2>Breadboard Power Supply</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of the introductory EE courses at the University of Washington require the use of two 
        9V batteries to power analog circuitry on a breadboard for labs, and the wires would always
        fall out of the breadboards. To pass the time during my first week back before courses started 
        in my sophomore year, I designed a USB powered breadboard PSU that provides quiet dual supplies 
        that can be adjusted from +-2V to +-15V and gave one to everyone on the electronics team in the 
        Husky Satellite Lab:

        Practice with low power modes on the STM32. I made a little clock that told the time in Chinese 
        on an Epaper display. It is powered with a single CR2032 and I'm very proud of the PCB.

      <h2>VU Meter/Spectrum Analyzer</h2>
      <p>
        An old friend of mine is a musician, so I made them an STM32 based VU Meter that would change 
        colors depending on the frequencies of the received sound. After sketching out an implementation
        that used <i>a lot</i> of VCVS stages, I decided to use a digital implementation instead. A simple 
        microphone amplifier circuit feeds the raw sound signal to the ADC of an STM32F4, which DMAs a few
        milliseconds worth of samples into a buffer and then uses the ARM CMSIS DSP library to take an FFT. 
        The brightness of the RGB leds around the PCB is set in real time by the coefficients from the FFT.

      <p>
        Lessons learned in high speed PCB layout. To burn some time with a friend, I built a 16 by 160 LED 
        dot matrix from scratch with 2560 LEDs from LCSC (only $30!). This system is driven by a Raspberry Pi
        running some <i>very</i> lazy code which seems to run fine. The characters are read out of a file
        listing Shanghai metro stops, rendered in GNU Unifont, converted to numpy arrays and then shifted into
        the matrix.

      <h2>UV Mask Sterilizer</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the pandemic, my father (who is a doctor) and his colleagues were placing used 
        medical masks in paper bags and leaving them in a dry room for two days before reusing them. After 
        the University of Nebraska published a study suggesting that UV light could be used to sterilize 
        N95 Masks without damaging them, my father asked me if I could replicate the system quickly. The 
        resulting device was constructed from a duct from Home Depot and two UVC flourescent lamps from 
        McMaster-Carr, and it would deliver the required dose to the mask in 7 seconds.

      <p>
        My grandparents needed a system to water their planter boxes when they were away from their apartment, 
        but without a hose on their balcony, they would need to use a bucket instead. I built a system that could
        turn on an aquarium pump for a user-specified amount of time once every 24 hours (my first HDL project!)
        and etched a PCB for it. The PCB is potted in 5 minute epoxy for waterproofing.

        My roommate wanted to make an LED cube for his girlfriend, so I built him a driver for it that he could 
        connect directly to a raspberry pi. We went as far as building the cube, but after the pandemic started 
        he wasn't able to give it to her.

      <h2>DAMIC Heater and Ramp Generator</h2>
      <p>
        In my first year at the University of Washington, I was an undergraduate research assistant for the DAMIC
        collaboration. There, I designed and built a 100 Watt linear (yes, linear) heater controller for keeping
        the dark matter detectors at the right temperature during testing. The system was incredibly sensitive to 
        noise, so no switching components could be used. 

        Later, I build a ramp generator which would allow a user to program the slew rate of the bias lines that
        powered the detector. The ramp generator had to consume absolutely no current when it was on or off, and 
        the bias voltage had to be able to change between 40 and 200V.

        I can control my desk lamp with my phone. I also made a high power grow light using some industrial 
        horticultural LEDs that turns on when the sun is out and turn off when the lights turn off. I also 
        fixed all of the three way switches in my house.
