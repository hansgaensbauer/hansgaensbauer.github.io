    <h2>Random/Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>

    A lof of my projects weren't well documented enough to get their own section (and a lot of them are too
    ridiculous or useless to deserve one). I've put the rest of the photos that I have here.

    <img src="images/lccs.jpg" alt="A raspberry pi submerged in mineral oil" >
    An excuse to put a raspberry pi in a box of mineral oil. The Raspberry Pi is overclocked and a close friend wrote
    a program to plot the CPU temperature over time. The liquid cooling actually worked!

    I gave a presentation about hacking the GPIO functionality of an RTL-SDR Dongle at the Society of Amateur Radio
    Astronomers (SARA) Conference 2019.

    I did some work on making a wall scale capacitive touchscreen at the Makerspace where I worked.

    <img src="images/paste.jpg" alt="Paste Extruder in Action" >
    <img src="images/paste_dissasembled.jpg" alt="Disassembled paste extruder" >
    I made a paste extruder for a 3D printer at the makerspace where I worked. The upper photo shows it printing with
    royal icing. The entire mechanism is my design, I 3d printed most of the parts and laser cut the gears out of acrylic.

    <img src="images/antenna_tower.jpg" alt="My antenna tower" >
    I built an antenna tower and mounted it on my roof. In this photo, it has a 134MHz V dipole for receiving APT from NOAA
    weather satellites.

    I used the DE1-SoC for one of my digital design courses to build the glue logic and memories for a Z80 microprocessor.

    <img src="images/dac_eval.jpg" alt="Evaluation board for DAC5687" >
    I made this DIY breakout board for the DAC5687 for developing the DDS.

    <img src="images/temp1.png" alt="A graph of temperature over time for the temp controller" >
    I was interested in making aluminum PCBs, so I designed one that fits on a heatsink and supports a
    single temperature sensor IC. When the device is sitting on my desk, I can see my air conditioning
    turning on and off, but when I set up a PID loop on an arduino with the peltier module, the PCB
    temperature is held relatively constant.

    <img src="images/pv.jpg" alt="My solar power system" >
    <img src="images/latching-relay.jpg" alt="A custom latching relay driver on a breadboard" >
    I've designed solar power systems a few times, but none of the had even been built and I wanted to
    develop some intuition for how this stuff goes together. I bought the cheapest parts I could find,
    and I took the opportunity to have some fun building a completely analog latching relay driver for
    the UVLO on the load.
    <hr>
    <img src="images/emc.jpg" alt="A DIY emc probe" >
    I built an EMC probe using soe RG316 coax and a ferrite bead, using the EEVblog video as a guide. I
    printed an enclosure for mine.
