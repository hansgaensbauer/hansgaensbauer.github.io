    <h2>LED Matrix</h2>
    <p>
    Lessons learned in high speed PCB layout. To burn some time with a friend, I built a 16 by 160 LED
    dot matrix from scratch with 2560 LEDs from LCSC (only $30!). This system is driven by a Raspberry Pi
    running some <i>very</i> lazy code which seems to run fine. The characters are read out of a file
    listing Shanghai metro stops, rendered in GNU Unifont, converted to numpy arrays and then shifted into
    the matrix.

    Sadly, I do not have any photos of the panels after they were assembled. There were 16 panels and one
    controller PCB that attached to one end and contained a power supply and the mosfets for controlling
    the anodes.
