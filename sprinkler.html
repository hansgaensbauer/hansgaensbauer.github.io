    <h2>Sprinkler Timer</h2>
    <p>
    My grandparents needed a system to water their planter boxes when they were away from their apartment,
    but without a hose on their balcony, they would need to use a bucket instead. I built a system that could
    turn on an aquarium pump for a user-specified amount of time once every 24 hours (my first HDL project!)
    and etched a PCB for it. The PCB is potted in 5 minute epoxy for waterproofing, and it used a Xilinx Coolrunner II
    CPLD.
