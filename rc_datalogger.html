    <h2>RC Airplane Datalogger</h2>
    <p>
        One of my friends was interested in building and flying remote control aircraft, so I made
        a device that "hides" between the receiver and the servo motor connectors. The device saves
        the PWM duty cycle of each of the six receiver channels to an SD card, so that the position
        of each of the control surfaces could be logged over the course of a flight. Additionally, the
        datalogger was equipped with a triaxial magnetometer and a six axis IMU.

        As of this writing, I am still waiting for them to conduct a successful flight, but I have
        faith that they will pull it off, and I'll post any data we get here.
